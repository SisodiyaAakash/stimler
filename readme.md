## Notice
- Hello, I've tried my best point of view to make it similar to the provided reference, however in few elements I've tried but not get the optimum solution, or got solution but not feasible for now, so added alternate solution such as the one by one character color changing animation was a bit complex for this time, so added animation on scroll for few more elements, also modified few things to improve user experience such as header mobile in the reference is not good on toggle open menu if viewport is on the top of the webpage.
- I hope my efforts to make it similar with same or alternate features make me an ideal candidate to complete this round.
